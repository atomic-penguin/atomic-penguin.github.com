    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the 2011 Chef developer summit there has been amazing community growth.  There has especially been strong community growth in the COOK, or cookbook, project.</p>

<p>It has certainly been said before, the COOK project is one of the most approachable Opscode Chef projects.  Nobody knows your business and application requirements better than you.  The great thing about tools like Puppet and Chef is providing a framework to easily automate and document those requirements in code.</p>

<p>Read on, for a look back at what has changed since the last community summit, and also some nifty visualizations I have put together.  I will share the technical details of extracting these statistics and visualizaions from git, in my next post.</p>

<p>In November 2011, the first Opscode Chef developer summit was held in Seattle. <img src="/images/20121018/opschef-cook-20111201.png" title="opschef COOK project 2011" alt="opschef COOK project 2011" />
Andrew Crump's foodcritic cookbook linting tool was released. Bryan Berry started the Food Fight community podcast (16:40). The Opscode Chef COOK project was filter-branched (split) into over a hundred mini-projects (17:04). Finally, the inaugural Chefconf took place with over 400 attendees this last May (18:45).</p>

<p>I have stitched the cookbook mini-projects back together, to render a gource visualization of the COOK project as a whole. The gource visualization includes the 134 officially supported Opscode cookbooks. The number of Opscode Chef cookbooks which are maintained by the community exceeds 600 when this was rendered.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had such a blast at the inaugural Chefconf in San Francisco, CA.  This was my first time visiting the area, I had a chance to visit the <a href="https://plus.google.com/112791157300091682319/posts/2Dr6BMnBqHH">Alcatraz</a> prison.  I also drank a lot of <a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/anchor_steam">Anchor Steam</a>, while pair programming with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!fnichol">Fletcher Nichol</a> to make the NTP cookbook a reference cookbook for testing Chef recipes.</p>

<p>During my second appearance on the Food Fight show, we covered what we hacked on throughout Chefconf with regard to Travis CI automated testing.  We also talked a bit about what we are doing internally with Jenkins to test our cookbook code.  Here is the link to the podcast <a href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/foodfight/FoodFightShowEpisode17.mp3">audio</a> and also the show <a href="http://foodfightshow.org/2012/06/episode-17-testing-with-eric-g-wolfe.html">notes</a>.</p>
