I had such a blast at the inaugural Chefconf in San Francisco, CA.  This was my first time visiting the area, I had a chance to visit the [Alcatraz](https://plus.google.com/112791157300091682319/posts/2Dr6BMnBqHH) prison.  I also drank a lot of [Anchor Steam](http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/anchor_steam), while pair programming with [Fletcher Nichol](http://twitter.com/#!fnichol) to make the NTP cookbook a reference cookbook for testing Chef recipes.

During my second appearance on the Food Fight show, we covered what we hacked on throughout Chefconf with regard to Travis CI automated testing.  We also talked a bit about what we are doing internally with Jenkins to test our cookbook code.  Here is the link to the podcast [audio](http://traffic.libsyn.com/foodfight/FoodFightShowEpisode17.mp3) and also the show [notes](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/06/episode-17-testing-with-eric-g-wolfe.html).
